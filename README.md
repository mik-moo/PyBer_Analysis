# PyBer_Analysis

Module 5

## Overview

This analysis was conducted as a supplement to the original PyBer Analysis which looked at fares, drivers and rides for Urban, Suburban and Rural areas.  This supplement presents a summary of the ride-sharing data with a final visualization that depicts the total weekly fares per city type.

## Results

The Urban city type had the most revenue overall at approximately $40, 000. Suburban was next with approximately $19,000 and lastly, Rural made just over $4,000.  Urban had the most rides and drivers which contributed to the large revenue seen for this type.  Suburban and Rural followed the same trends as before with rural bringing the least amount of rides and drivers.  The trends reversed when talking about the average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  Rural saw the highest numbers here and Urban was the lowest in these categories.  The chart below shows these results in more detail.
